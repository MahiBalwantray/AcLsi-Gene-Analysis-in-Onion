# üß¨ Identification and Characterization of AcLsi Genes in Onion (Allium cepa)

This repository contains all the data, analysis scripts, and results from my major bioinformatics project titled **‚ÄúIdentification and Characterization of *AcLsi Genes* in Onion (*Allium cepa*)‚Äù**.  
The study explores the **molecular identification, domain architecture, evolutionary relationships, and functional roles** of silicon transporter genes (*AcLsi*) in the onion genome using computational biology tools.

## üå± Overview

Silicon (Si) plays a vital role in enhancing plant growth, stress tolerance, and cell wall strength. This project aimed to **identify and characterize silicon transporter genes** in *Allium cepa* using genome-wide computational analysis.

Through sequence mining, domain annotation, and phylogenetic studies, the project identified **seven *AcLsi* genes** ‚Äî *AcLsi1-1* to *AcLsi1-6* and *AcLsi2* ‚Äî that potentially regulate silicon uptake and transport within onion cells.

## üéØ Objectives

- Identify and annotate **silicon transporter (*AcLsi)** genes in the *Allium cepa* genome.  
- Predict **motifs, domains**, and **physicochemical properties** of *AcLsi* proteins.  
- Analyze **phylogenetic relationships** with known *Lsi* homologs from other monocots.  
- Perform **gene duplication and synteny mapping** to understand evolutionary expansion.  
- Conduct **Gene Ontology (GO)** and **Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction (PPI)** analyses to predict biological roles.

## üß´ Key Results

- **Seven AcLsi genes** were identified in *Allium cepa*:  
  *AcLsi1-1, AcLsi1-2, AcLsi1-3, AcLsi1-4, AcLsi1-5, AcLsi1-6, and AcLsi2*.  
- **AcLsi1-type proteins** belong to the **MIP (Major Intrinsic Protein) superfamily** ‚Üí involved in **silicon influx**.  
- **AcLsi2** carries the **CitMHS domain**, typical of **silicon efflux transporters**.  
- **Phylogenetic analysis** grouped AcLsi1s with known Lsi1/Lsi6 transporters and AcLsi2 with Lsi2-type efflux transporters from rice, barley, and sorghum.  
- **Gene duplication analysis** showed multiple **segmental duplications** under **purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 1)**.  
- **GO enrichment** highlighted roles in **transmembrane transport, ion homeostasis, and cellular localization**.  
- **PPI network** suggested strong interaction with aquaporins (NIP, PIP, SIP families), indicating roles in nutrient and water transport.
